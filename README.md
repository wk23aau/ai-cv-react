# AI CV Editor

## Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered CV editor that helps users create and tailor their resumes with the assistance of generative AI. Its purpose is to simplify and enhance the CV writing process, making it easier for users to craft compelling and targeted resumes.

## Project Structure
- `components/`: Contains React UI components.
  - `panels/`: Components for different editor panels (content, theme).
  - `shared/`: Common shared components (e.g., ErrorMessage, LoadingSpinner).
- `services/`: Houses services, like `geminiService.ts` for AI integration.
- `App.tsx`: The main application React component.
- `index.tsx`: The entry point for the React application, renders App.tsx.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file template used by Vite.
- `constants.tsx`: Application-wide constants, including themes and initial CV data.
- `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions for data structures.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration for the Vite build tool, including environment variable setup.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies, scripts (like `dev`, `build`).
- `package-lock.json`: Records exact versions of dependencies.
- `Dockerfile`: For building and running the application in a Docker container.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.
- `dist/`: (Generated after `npm run build`) Contains the production-ready static assets.

## Development Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
2. Add your Gemini API key to this file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   *Note: The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of your API key.*

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production
1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command will generate a `dist` folder in the project root, containing the optimized static assets for your application.

## Running the Production Build Locally
You can preview the production build locally using Vite's preview command:
```bash
npm run preview
```
This will serve the contents of the `dist` folder, typically at `http://localhost:4173`.

Alternatively, you can use any static file server. For example, using `serve`:
1. Install `serve` globally (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```
2. Serve the `dist` folder:
   ```bash
   serve -s dist
   ```
   This will typically make the application available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
The `dist` folder generated by `npm run build` contains all the static files needed to deploy the application. You can deploy this folder to any static hosting service, such as:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3
- Firebase Hosting

Ensure that your hosting service is configured to serve `index.html` for all routes if you are using client-side routing (though this project seems to be a single-page application where this might be less of an issue).

Ensure the `GEMINI_API_KEY` is handled appropriately in your deployment environment. For client-side applications, it's crucial **not to expose the API key directly in the frontend code that gets shipped to the browser if it's a secret/paid key.** The current setup using `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` in `vite.config.ts` will embed the key into the built JavaScript files. This is fine for free tier or development keys, but for production, consider using a backend proxy or serverless function to make API calls to Gemini, keeping the actual API key secure on the server-side. **For the purpose of this project, we will assume the current method is acceptable, but highlight this as a security consideration.**

## Key Features
- AI-powered CV content generation (summary, experience, skills).
- CV tailoring based on job descriptions.
- Multiple CV themes and customization options.
- Real-time preview of the CV.
- PDF download of the generated CV.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Gemini AI

## Running with Docker

This application can also be run in a Docker container.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.

### Building the Docker Image
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ai-cv-maker .
   ```
   If your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not set as an environment variable in the shell where you run the build command, you can pass it as a build argument:
   ```bash
   docker build --build-arg GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key" -t ai-cv-maker .
   ```

### Running the Docker Container
1. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 ai-cv-maker
   ```
   This will start the application, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
   Make sure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` was available during the build, or the application might not function correctly with the AI features.
