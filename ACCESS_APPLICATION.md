## Accessing the AI CV Maker Application

If you've successfully completed all the previous setup steps:
1.  [Database Setup](LINK_TO_DATABASE_SETUP.md) (is running)
2.  [Backend Server Setup](LINK_TO_BACKEND_SETUP.md) (dependencies installed and `.env` configured)
3.  [Backend Server Start](LINK_TO_BACKEND_START.md) (is running in a terminal)
4.  [Frontend Application Setup](LINK_TO_FRONTEND_START.md) (Docker image built and container is running)

Then the AI CV Maker application should now be up and running!

To access it:
*   Open any modern web browser (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari).
*   In the address bar, type the following URL and press Enter:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```

You should see the application's main page. You can now register for an account, log in, and start building your CV!

If you encounter any issues, please double-check the output in your terminal windows (for the backend server and Docker commands) for any error messages.
