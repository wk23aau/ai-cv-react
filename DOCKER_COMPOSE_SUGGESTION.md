## Future Improvement: Simplifying Setup with Docker Compose

We understand that the current setup process involves several manual steps and commands across different terminal windows to get the database, backend server, and frontend application all running together. This is common for multi-component applications during initial development.

### What is Docker Compose?

For a much simpler experience, especially for users who are not deeply technical, a tool called **Docker Compose** can be used. Docker Compose allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses a single configuration file (usually named `docker-compose.yml`) to set up all the application's services (like the database, backend, and frontend).

### Benefits of Using Docker Compose

*   **Simplified Commands:** Instead of running multiple `docker run`, `npm run dev`, etc., commands separately, you could start (and stop) the entire application with just one or two commands (e.g., `docker-compose up` to start everything and `docker-compose down` to stop everything).
*   **Easier Management:** It handles the networking between containers automatically.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures everyone runs the application with the same configuration.

### Recommendation for the Future

Creating a `docker-compose.yml` file for the AI CV Maker project is a **highly recommended future improvement**. This would significantly streamline the setup process, making it much easier for anyone (technical or non-technical) to get the entire application up and running quickly and reliably. It's an excellent step for improving team collaboration and making the project more accessible.
